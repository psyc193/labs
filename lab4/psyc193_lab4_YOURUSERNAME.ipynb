We will then cast this as an optimization problem in which we will minimize the loss function with respect to the parameters of the score function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first component of this approach is to define the score function that maps the pixel values of an image to confidence scores for each class. We will develop the approach with a concrete example. As before, let’s assume a training dataset of images xi∈RD, each associated with a label yi. Here i=1…N and yi∈1…K. That is, we have N examples (each with a dimensionality D) and K distinct categories. \n",

In `photodraw32`, $x_i$ either represents all pixels in the i-th image flattened into a single $[12288 x 1]$ column OR the 4096-dimensional feature vector extracted by VGG.\n",

However, you will often hear people use the terms weights and parameters interchangeably.\n",

Our goal will be to set these in such way that the computed scores match the ground truth labels across the whole training set. We will go into much more detail about how this is done, but intuitively we wish that the correct class has a score that is higher than the scores of incorrect classes.\n",
    "- An advantage of this approach is that the training data is used to learn the parameters W,b, but once the learning is complete we can discard the entire training set and only keep the learned parameters. That is because a new test image can be simply forwarded through the function and classified based on the computed scores.\n",

For the sake of visualization, we assume the image only has 4 pixels (4 monochrome pixels, we are not considering color channels in this example for brevity), and that we have 3 classes (red (cat), green (dog), blue (ship) class). (Clarification: in particular, the colors here simply indicate 3 classes and are not related to the RGB channels.) We stretch the image pixels into a column and perform matrix multiplication to get the scores for each class. Note that this particular set of weights W is not good at all: the weights assign our cat image a very low cat score. In particular, this set of weights seems convinced that it's looking at a dog.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since we defined the score of each class as a weighted sum of all image pixels, each class score is a linear function over this space. We cannot visualize 4096-dimensional spaces, but if we imagine squashing all those dimensions into only two dimensions, then we can try to visualize what the classifier might be doing:\n",

The red arrow shows the direction of increase, so all points to the right of the red line have positive (and linearly increasing) scores, and all points to the left have a negative (and linearly decreasing) scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, every row of W is a classifier for one of the classes. The geometric interpretation of these numbers is that as we change one of the rows of W, the corresponding line in the pixel space will rotate in different directions. The biases b, on the other hand, allow our classifiers to translate the lines. In particular, note that without the bias terms, plugging in xi=0 would always give score of zero regardless of the weights, so all lines would be forced to cross the origin.\n",

The score of each class for an image is then obtained by comparing each template with the image using an inner product (or dot product) one by one to find the one that “fits” best. With this terminology, the linear classifier is doing template matching, where the templates are learned. Another way to think of it is that we are still effectively doing Nearest Neighbor, but instead of having thousands of training images we are only using a single image per class (although we will learn it, and it does not necessarily have to be one of the images in the training set), and we use the (negative) inner product as the distance instead of the L1 or L2 distance.\n",

Moreover, we saw that we don’t have control over the data $(x_i,y_i)$ (it is fixed and given), but we do have control over these weights and we want to set them so that the predicted class scores are consistent with the ground truth labels in the training data.\n",

    "For example, going back to the example image of a cat and its scores for the classes “cat”, “dog” and “ship”, we saw that the particular set of weights in that example was not very good at all: We fed in the pixels that depict a cat but the cat score came out very low (-96.8) compared to the other classes (dog score 437.9 and ship score 61.95). We are going to measure our unhappiness with outcomes such as this one with a loss function (or sometimes also referred to as the cost function or the objective). Intuitively, the loss will be high if we’re doing a poor job of classifying the training data, and it will be low if we’re doing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Multiclass Support Vector Machine loss\n",
    "There are several ways to define the details of the loss function. As a first example we will first develop a commonly used loss called the Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) loss. The SVM loss is set up so that the SVM “wants” the correct class for each image to a have a score higher than the incorrect classes by some fixed margin Δ. Notice that it’s sometimes helpful to anthropomorphise the loss functions as we did above: The SVM “wants” a certain outcome in the sense that the outcome would yield a lower loss (which is good).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now get more precise. Recall that for the i-th example we are given the pixels of image xi and the label yi that specifies the index of the correct class. The score function takes the pixels and computes the vector $f(x_i,W)$ of class scores, which we will abbreviate to s (short for scores). For example, the score for the j-th class is the j-th element: $s_j=f(x_i,W)_j$. The Multiclass SVM loss for the i-th example is then formalized as follows:\n",

    "$$L_i = \\sum_{j\\neq y_i} \\max(0, s_j - s_{y_i} + \\Delta) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multiclass Support Vector Machine \"wants\" the score of the correct class to be higher than all other scores by at least a margin of delta. If any class has a score inside the red region (or higher), then there will be accumulated loss. Otherwise the loss will be zero. Our objective will be to find the weights that will simultaneously satisfy this constraint for all examples in the training data and give a total loss that is as low as possible.\n",
